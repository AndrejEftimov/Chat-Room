# Network Programming

This is a university project for my **Network Programming** course at [FEEIT](https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/). The project is a simple client-server application  written in Python which utilises *OOP* where multiple clients/users can connect with the server and exchange messages in a shared **Chat Room**, as well as send messages to other users. Users are required to register, if they haven't already, and login in order to use the chat. The UI on the client side is implemented using the *Streamlit* library. Below is a video/demo of how the application works:
