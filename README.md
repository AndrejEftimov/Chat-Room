# Network Programming

This is a university project for my **Network Programming** course at [FEEIT](https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/). The project is a simple client-server application  written in Python where multiple clients/users can connect with the server and exchange messages in a shared **Chat Room**. It utilises *OOP* as well as *functional programming*. Users are required to register, if they haven't already, and login in order to use the chat. The UI on the client side is implemented using the *tkinter* library. Below is a video/demo of how the application works:
